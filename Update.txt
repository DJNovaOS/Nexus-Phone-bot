error and close safly. before the system was ignoring the log manager and was not able to close properly. Now the system reacts accordingly.

Why did this error happen:
As of right now we are working on implementing a new check for this system. What this means is that it will display the real reason
this is happening and not this confusing log. But this error occurs when the number your attacking types "Stop" when the SMS attack occurred.
